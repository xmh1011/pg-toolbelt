         * CYCLE DESCRIPTION:
         * - A sequence is owned by a table column (via OWNED BY)
         * - A table is created with a column that uses that sequence via DEFAULT nextval(...)
         *
         * DEPENDENCIES CREATING THE CYCLE:
         * 1. Column default (pg_attrdef) → Sequence (via pg_depend: column default depends on sequence)
         *    - This creates: column:test_schema.users.id → sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq
         * 2. Sequence → Column/Table (via pg_depend: sequence ownership, deptype='a')
         *    - This creates: sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq → column:test_schema.users.id
         *    - OR: sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq → table:test_schema.users
         *
         * CYCLE PATH:
         * sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq → column:test_schema.users.id → sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq
         * OR
         * sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq → table:test_schema.users → sequence:test_schema.user_id_seq
         *
         * HOW IT'S BROKEN:
         * The dependency-filter.ts filters out the ownership dependency FROM the sequence
         * TO the table/column it's owned by, breaking the cycle. This is safe because:
         * - CREATE phase: sequences should be created before tables (ownership set via ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY after both exist)
         * - DROP phase: prevents cycles when dropping sequences owned by tables that aren't being dropped
         *
         * EXPECTED ORDER (after cycle breaking):
         * 1. CREATE SEQUENCE (no dependencies)
         * 2. CREATE TABLE (depends on sequence via column default)
         * 3. ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY (depends on table/column)
